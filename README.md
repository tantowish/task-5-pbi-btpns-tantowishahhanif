## About Project

This is a Restful API created as the final project for a Project-based Internship at Bank BTPN Syariah. In this project, we were put to the test in the realm of the Go programming language by developing a Restful API that adheres to predefined requirements. This Restful API comprises two endpoints: the User Endpoint (for Login and Register functions) and the Photo Endpoint. In the final task of the PBI Full Stack Developer program, we were directed to create an API based on the given use case. In this scenario, we are instructed to develop an API for uploading and deleting images. The API we were building consists of the following HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
