## About Project

This is a Restful API created as the final project for a Virtual Internship at Bank BTPN Syariah. In this project, our knowledge was put to the test in the realm of the Go programming language by developing a Restful API that adheres to predefined requirements. This Restful API comprises two endpoints: the User Endpoint (for Login and Register functions) and the Photo Endpoint.
